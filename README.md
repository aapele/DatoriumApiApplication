A program we developed in class to demonstrate how APIs are built.
We are using SpringBoot Application. 

We programmed files:
  * DatoriumApiApplication.java - main file (first tests were done from there)
  * User.java - User class
  * UserService.java - contains business logic
  * UserController.java - contains mapping
  * UserRepo.java - contains logic to access database

In addition, I use locally DB Browser for SQLite and Postman.
